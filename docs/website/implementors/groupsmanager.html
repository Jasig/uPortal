            The Groups Manager channel is a tool

            The uPortal 2.1 group service is a
            composite service made up of one or more component services. Each
            group service functions to represent group information in a
            consistent manner. The default implementation is delivered with a
            group service that uses the portal database as its source. Therefore,
            as delivered, the composite group service only has one component
            service that is called &quot;local&quot; A demo LDAP component
            service can be configured by uncommeting the ldap section in the
            property file compositeGroupServices.xml located in the
            /properties/group directory. This will setup an &quot;ldap&quot; service
            that uses the Columbia LDAP directory as its source. If you want to
            use another LDAP directory, you should modify the
            LDAPGroupStoreConfig.xml file located in the same file directory. It
            should also be kept in mind that group information from some services
            may be read-only. For a more detailed discussion of configuration
            issues, refer to the

            The groups framework represents a
            network of groups. A group can be a member of zero or more groups.
            The group members have privileges assigned to them directly or by
            virtue of their membership in a containing group (i.e. inherited from
            the hierarchy of group memberships).  As such, the framework allows
            for multi-inheritance. This is important to realize while using the
            Groups Manager channel because the question soon arises where one
            starts the representation of the groups system. The uPortal 2.1 group
            service allows for the definition of special groups called root
            groups. A 
            <B>
              root group
            </B>
            is a special group that is the parent of
            all groups of a specific entity type. Although the groups framework
            does not enforce this relationship, the groups manager channel
            requires root groups to organize the opening view. Root groups are
            also used by the search function to discover the entity types that
            can be searched. In the default implementation, the &quot;All
            categories&quot; group (see Figure 1) is the root group of all channel
            definition groups and the &quot;Everyone&quot; group is the root group of
            all IPerson groups. Root groups are defined in the portal properties
            file as properties named with the prefix
            &quot;org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_&quot; followed by an
            entity type class name. These properties are used by a group service
            to determine which groups are root groups. The value of the property
            is the group key. This key takes the form groupServiceName.key in the
            default implementation. (See
            <I>
              <A href = "#appendix2">Appendix II: Creating New Root Groups</A>
            </I>

            <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
            As mentioned above, the group members
            have permissions assigned to them directly or by virtue of their
            membership in a group. In regards to permissions owned by the Groups
            Manager channel, the distinguished group of 
            <B>
              portal administrators
            </B>
            is an exception to this. This group does not have any privileges
            explicitly granted to them. Membership in this group implicitly
            grants all permissions within the Groups Manager by effectively
            ignoring permission checking. The portal administrators group is
            defined in the portal properties file with the property named
            org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson.PortalAdministrators.
            The value is the group key of the group which contains all portal
            administrators. The following entry is currently found in the portal
            properties file of the default installation:

            When the Groups Manager opens, the channel displays all root groups (see 
            <A href = "#overview">Overview</A>
            above) for which the
            user has view permissions (see Figure 1). A group can be expanded by
            clicking on the 
            <IMG SRC="images/expand.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
            icon or collapsed by clicking on the 
            <IMG SRC="images/collapse.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
            icon. User permissions determine the group members that the user sees
            as well as the functions that are made available for each group
            member. Some functionality may also be withheld because the group
            service itself is read-only. If a user does not have permission to
            view a parent group (e.g. Faculty), but does have permissions for a
            sub-group (e.g. Tenured Professors), the parent group will not be
            visible. If the group Tenured Professors is not a member of any other
            group that is displayed, it will be invisible to the user from the
            tree view. The only way for the user to see the group is to search
            for it (See

            A user can search for any entity type
            that is contained by a root group and for any group of such entities.
            With the default implementation, you can therefore search for
            IPersons, IEntityGroups of IPersons, IChannelDefinitions, and
            IEntityGroups of IChannelDefinitions. Searching is not available
            while in edit mode. To search for the group Tenured Professors (see
            Figure 5), change the first search argument to &quot;Group of Persons&quot;,
            the second argument to &quot;contains&quot; or &quot;starts with&quot; and the
            third argument to &quot;Tenured&quot;. If you only want to search within
            the currently selected group, click on the 
            <B>
              &quot;Search only descendants of the selected group&quot;
            </B>
            checkbox. After clicking on
            <B>
              Go
            </B>
            , a new 
            <B>
              Search results
            </B>
            element will be created that
            contains an element for each member of the result set, in this case,
            one element for Tenured Professors. The search element is a special
            non-persistent group (i.e. not saved to the groups data store) that
            has as its members all of the group members that were found as a
            result of the search arguments. This is a demonstration of the
            networked nature of the groups framework. The search element can be
            manipulated like any other persistent group element except it can not
            be edited. In this regard, it is like an element for a group held by
            a read only group service with the exception that you cannot assign
            permissions to a search element. Deleting a search element simply
            removes the element from the view and has no affect on the groups
            themselves. On the other hand, the search result elements held by the
            search element are &quot;real&quot; group members that can be manipulated
            like any other persistent group within the limits of the user&apos;s
            privileges. This includes being able to select the groups in order to
            add them to another group. Group members held by all component group
            services will be discovered once they are configured.  Group services
            configuration was discussed in the

            At present, the Groups Manager channel
            does not have a function to create root groups for new entity types.
            In order to manage a new entity type through the Groups Manager
            channel, you must do the following:
            <BR>
            <BR>
            1. Create the new entity type class
            (e.g. org.jasig.portal.IBook).
            <BR>
            <BR>
            2. Use the groups framework to add the new entity type to the
            UP_ENTITY_TYPE datastore. This can be done by using the Groups
            framework class EntityTypes by running the instance method:
            <BR>
            <BR>
            addEntityType(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;), &quot;Books
            of all types&quot;)
            <BR>
            <BR>
            3. Use the groups framework to create a parent group for this entity
            type. Use the Groups framework service class static methods:
            <BR>
            <BR>
            GroupService.newGroup(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;))
            <BR>
            OR 
            <BR>
            GroupService.newGroup(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;),
            amazonCom).
            <BR>
            <BR>
            4. Add a new property to portal properties assigning the group key of
            the group created in step 3 as a root group for the new type. This
            would look something like:
            <BR>
            <BR>
            org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.IBook
            =local.99
            <BR>
            OR
            <BR>
            org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.IBook
            =amazonCom.99
            <BR>
            <DIV ID="sdfootnote1">
              <P CLASS="sdfootnote-western">
              <HR>
              <BR>
              <A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>
              This view is actually the Permissions Manager channel running in
              servant mode with the Groups Manager channel as the master channel.
              The Permissions Manager channel looks just like the Groups Manager
              channel because the first thing that Permissions Manager does is
              call up the Groups Manager channel in servant mode.
