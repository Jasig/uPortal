    <h2>About This Document</h2>
    <p>
    This document reflects the current version of CWebProxy.
    See the <a href="cw2.0.html">old documentation</a> for versions
    prior to uPortal 2.1.  See <a href="#changes">Changes</a>
    for a summary of the major changes.  The latest version
    of this document can be found at the
    <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/">CWebProxy home page</a>.
    There is also a 
    <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/tutorial/">tutorial</a>
    on creating channels using CWebProxy.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
    CWebProxy allows incorporation of web-based services as
    channels, regardless of what technology is used to implement them.
    It provides mechanisms for connecting to and rendering HTML and XML
    services. Pages are refreshed and kept in-channel when they change.
    HTTP standards are followed, allowing communication between the
    browser and dynamic back-end applications.  Mechanisms are provided
    for passing user-specific information to the back-end application, as
    well as ways to support local interface technologies on a per-channel
    basis.  (Such as encryption, shared secrets, single-sign-on,
    modification of http request headers, etc.)
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
    This section describes the functionality of CWebProxy in general terms.
    Specifics of configuration and use are covered in the sections following.
    </p>
    <p>
    Web applications are written to interact directly with users
    through their browsers.  When a portal incorporates such an
    application, it must intercept this communication to tailor
    it for the portal environment.  This is done by rewriting the
    application's output appropriately.  In particular, rewriting
    any URLs so that they will go through the portal if appropriate,
    rather than directly to the back-end application or elsewhere.
    Other mechanisms allow sharing of information between the portal
    and the application, to aid application functionality.  Caching
    is available to improve performance.
    </p>
    <h3>Rewriting Application Output</h3>
    <p>
    The key mechanism is "<i>pass-through</i>". It is the means for
    <i>passing</i> request parameters <i>through</i> the portal to
    the application.  There are currently four levels of pass-through
    supported: 
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li><b>all</b>: all links stay in the channel.</li>

        <li><b>application</b>: references to the application
	stay in the channel.  Other links go outside the portal
	framework.  I.e. they are normal links that replace the
	portal in the browser window.</li>

	<li><b>marked</b>: the application indicates which
	links should stay in channel by adding a tag to those URLs.</li>

	<li><b>none</b>: all links will leave the portal framework.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    Note that it is possible to change the pass-through type at
    any point, so if a link is followed that would best be served
    by another pass-though type, it is a trivial matter to change
    it at that time.
    </p>

    <p>
    The output from applications is rewritten in four stages.
    HTML, XHTML, and WML are supported in the code as distributed.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>JTidy</b>:  If the cw_tidy attribute is on, the application's
          output is run through JTidy to convert it from HTML to well-formed
          XHTML.</li>
      <li><b>AbsoluteURLFilter</b>:  This converts relative URLs to absolute
          ones.</li>
      <li><b>CWebProxyURLFilter</b>:  Rewrites URLs according to cw_passThrough
          or cw_download.</li>
      <li><b>XSL/T</b>:  The XML is passed through a stylesheet according
          to the channel parameters and the media type.  Static and runtime
	  data parameters are passed to the stylesheet.  This feature is
	  not used by the distributed stylesheets, but may prove useful to
	  custom-written stylesheets, particularly those with no URL Filters.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    CWebProxy will use the same method (GET or POST) to call the application
    as was used to call the portal.  Since the portal is intercepting HTTP
    requests aimed at the application, this will result in the correct method
    being used, according to what the application expects.
    </p>

    <p>
    CWebProxy will filter out any attribute/value pairs in the query string
    which are portal-specific, and hand on any others that were in the URL
    to the application.  Note that querystrings may also contain keywords
    without using the attribute/value format.  In this case they are also
    passed on to the application.  Although you mix this type of querystring
    with mechanisms that will generate attribute/value pairs, if it sees
    this happening, CWebProxy will pass the keywords by adding a "keywords"
    attribute with the appropriate value.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the case where CWebProxy needs the channel to provide refreshed output,
    it will call the application with no parameters, as is usual for HTTP.
    </p>

    <p>
    In some cases, you don't want a link to go through the normal mechanisms,
    but instead wish it to be handled as a download for an object with its
    own MIME type.  CWebProxy includes a way to indicate this.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
    <p>
    Applications can benefit by getting information from the portal.  CWebProxy
    supports the standard HTTP Cookie mechanism for keeping session and state
    information between page requests.  Additionally, it can pass information
    on the user from the uPortal IPerson object.  There is also support for
    customizing the communications to fit local policy and technical infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h4>Session Support</h4>
    <p>
    Support is provided for cookies as specified in the original
    Netscape specification, as well as RFC 2109 and RFC 2965. Only
    the <b>Cookie</b>, <b>Cookie2</b>, <b>Set-Cookie</b>, and
    <b>Set-Cookie2</b> headers are currently processed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cookies are not maintained between portal logins. Once you
    logout of the portal, your cookies are discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
    Applications maintaining sessions via URL rewriting in http
    query strings should also work. Other forms of URL rewriting to
    maintain state probably will not work. Most applications use
    cookies by preference if available, which they are.
    </p>

    <h4>IPerson Attribute Passing</h4>
    <p>
    uPortal maintains certain user information (called the IPerson object),
    possibly aggregated from several sources, for each active user session.
    CWebProxy allows the application to request this information.  At
    publish time, you may configure which information is allowed to be passed
    to applications, and you may also choose to always pass particular attributes
    by default.  These are sent as additional http request parameters.
    A uPortal configuration property sets the defaults for channels that
    do not specify publish-time values.
    </p>

    <h4>Local Connection Context</h4>
    <p>
    Connecting to, and communicating with, certain applications may require
    custom modifications to the communications.  For example, you might need
    to add special encryption, shared secret passing, hooks into authentication
    mechanisms, addition or filtering of headers or cookies, etc.  CWebProxy
    uses a mechanism called Local Connection Context to simplify and modularize
    this process on a per-channel basis.
    </p>

    <h3>Caching</h3>
    <p>
    Channel output maybe be cached to improve efficiency.  The three aspects
    of caching are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mode</b>: To cache or not to cache.  May be <b>none</b>
	  (normally don't cache), or <b>all</b> (cache by default).</li>

        <li><b>Scope</b>: Affects which instances of this channel share
	  cached data.  At this time only instance caching is available.</li>

	<!--
	  <ul>
            <li><b>system</b>: one copy for all users.</li>
	    <li><b>user</b>: one copy per user.  This is particularly useful
		for channels viewed by guest users and unlikely to have
		multiple instances where the same parameters would yield
		different output if a user subscribes to it more than once.</li>
 	    <li><b>instance</b>: each instance of the channel has its own cache.</li>
          </ul>
	-->

        <li><b>Timeout</b>:  How long cached output is valid in "all" mode.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
    For each of these, defaults are set in uPortal properties which may be
    overridden for each channel at publish time.  Applications may later
    change the defaults for a channel instance, or override them for a
    single page request.  Cache scope and mode can only be made more
    restrictive, not less.
    </p>

    <p>According to the HTML specification, "If the processing of a form is
       is idempotent (i.e. it has no lasting                            
       observable effect on the state of the world), then the form method 
       should be GET. Many database searches have no visible side-effects 
       and make ideal applications of query forms...If the service 
       associated with the processing of a form has side effects 
       (for example, modification of a database or subscription to a  
       service), the method should be POST."  For this reason, POST
       requests are not cached.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <h3>Static Data</h3>
    Except as noted, parameters are identical for both static and
    runtime data. The channel state variables are initially set
    acccording to static data, or defaults. Runtime data modifies
    the equivalent channel state variables. All parameters are then
    passed through to the stylesheets based on the current state.
    The parameters are: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>cw_xml</b>: a URI representing the source XML or HTML
      document.  I.e. the backend application.</li>

      <li><b>cw_ssl</b>: a URI representing the corresponding .ssl
      (stylesheet list) file.</li>

      <li><b>cw_xslTitle</b>: a title representing the stylesheet
      (optional). If no title parameter is specified, a default
      stylesheet will be chosen according to the media.</li>

      <li><b>cw_xsl</b>: a URI representing the stylesheet to use.
      If <i>cw_xsl</i> is supplied, <i>cw_ssl</i> and
      <i>cw_xslTitle</i> will be ignored.</li>

      <li><b>cw_info</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>info</i>
      event.</li>

      <li><b>cw_help</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>help</i>
      event.</li>

      <li><b>cw_edit</b>: a URI to be called for the <i>edit</i>
      event.</li>
      
      <li><b>cw_tidy</b>: if set to <i>on</i>, filter the source
      document through JTidy, converting HTML to XHTML.</li>

      <li>
        <b>cw_passThrough</b>: indicates that runtime data not specific
	to the portal is to be passed through. If <i>passThrough</i> is
	supplied, and not set to "none", additional runtime data parameters
	and values will be passed as request parameters to the
        <i>cw_xml</i>.<br />
        cw_passThrough values: 
        <ul>
          <li><b>none</b>: (default). Don't do anything.</li>
          <li><b>marked</b>: If runtime data includes
          <i>cw_inChannelLink</i>, pass through other runtime data
          as request parameters.</li>
          <li><b>application</b>: Only URLs referring to the application
	  are kept in-channel.</li>
          <li><b>all</b>: All link URLs are rewritten to go through the
	  channel.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>cw_cacheDefaultTimeout</b> - Default timeout in seconds.</li>

      <li><b>cw_cacheDefaultMode</b> - Default caching mode.
	May be <i>none</i> (normally don't cache), or
	<i>all</i> (cache everything).</li>

      <li><b>cw_cacheTimeout</b> - override default for this request only.
	Primarily intended as a runtime parameter, but can
	user statically to override the first instance.</li>

      <li><b>cw_cacheMode</b> - override default for this request only.
	Primarily intended as a runtime parameter, but can
	user statically to override the first instance.</li>

      <li><b>cw_person</b> - IPerson attributes to pass.
	A comma-separated list of IPerson attributes to
	pass to the back end application.  The static data
	value will be passed on <i>all</i> requests not
	overridden by a runtime data cw_person.</li>

      <li><b>cw_personAllow</b> - Restrict IPerson attribute passing to this list.
	 A comma-separated list of IPerson attributes that
	 may be passed via cw_person.  An empty or non-existent
	 value means use the default value from the corresponding
	 property.  The special value "*" means all attributes
	 are allowed.  The value "!*" means none are allowed.
	 Static data only.</li>

      <li><b>upc_localConnContext</b> - LocalConnectionContext implementation class.
	The name of a class to use when data sent to the
	backend application needs to be modified or added
	to suit local needs.  Static data only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>
    CWebProxy has a few properties which act as portal-wide defaults for
    equivalent static data (channel publish-time parameters).  These are
    set in the <b>properties/portal.properties</b> configuration file.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>cache_default_timeout</b>:  Default value for
          <i>cw_cacheDefaultTimeout</i>.</li>
      <li><b>cache_default_mode</b>:  Default value for
          <i>cw_cacheDefaultMode</i>.  If you're not sure what
	  to use, disable caching by default with the value <i>none</i>.</li>
      <li><b>person_allow</b>:  Default value for <i>cw_personAllow</i>.  
          An empty value means everything is restricted, disabling
	  this mechanism.  A special value of <i>*</i> means no
	  restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Controlling CWebProxy Channels</h2>
    <p>
      Once it is running, you can control the behaviour a CWebProxy channel
      instance in two ways.  An HTTP application may pass instructions to
      the channel via portal runtime data, which means passing special
      attributes in the request query string.  Secondly, the channel
      reacts to certain portal events.  These are generally triggered
      by user actions, such as clicking on a channel button.
    </p>

    <h3>Runtime Data</h3>
    <p>
    Most static data parameters can be changed via the equivalent runtime
    data parameter, and have the same semantics.  The exceptions are
    <b>cw_person_allow</b> and <b>upc_localConnContext</b>.
    The following are runtime-only parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>cw_reset</b>: An instruction to reset internal
      variables. The value <i>return</i> resets <i>cw_xml</i> to
      its last value before changed by button events.
      </li>

      <li><b>cw_download</b>: Use download worker for this link or form.
        Any link or form that contains this parameter will be 
	handled by the download worker, if the pass-through mode 
	is set to rewrite the link or form.  This allows downloads
	from the proxied site to be delivered via the portal, 
	primarily useful if the download requires verification 
	of a session referenced by a proxied cookie</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Portal Events</h3>
    <p>
    CWebProxy supports the button events for <i>help</i>,
    <i>about</i>, and <i>edit</i>. A channel instance can specify
    URIs for any of these via static or runtime data. A button
    event will then redirect the channel to the appropriate URI.
    Note that these URIs are subject to the same filtering and
    stylesheets are the normal URI.  The event URI should return control
    to the original application via the runtime attribute
    <i>cw_reset=return</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues and Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JTidy must be recompiled to work with some servlet
      containers. See <b><a href="#depend">Software
      Dependencies</a></b>.</li>

      <li>HTTP-style caching is not yet implemented.</li>

      <li>HTML and XHTML <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> background colours and
      images are not reflected in the output.</li>

      <li>Any <b>&lt;link&gt;</b> elements from the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>
      of an HTML document, including those that reference CSS stylesheets,
      are not reflected in the output.  This would require
      access to the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element generated by the portal.</li>

      <li>URLs that use frames cannot be incorporated as
      channels.</li>

      <li>Suppression of JTidy diagnostic output has not been
      tested on non-UNIX platforms.</li>

      <li>UTF-8 is the default character encoding for JTidy.  If
      the character encoding is specified in the HTTP headers,
      CWebProxy will set it accordingly. Note that
      JTidy does not yet recognize the use of the HTML meta element 
      for specifying the character encoding.</li>

      <li>The cw_reset=reset runtime command is not implemented
      yet.</li>

      <li>If cw_xml is changed before cw_reset=return is called,
      your are returned to the last cw_xml used, not necessarily
      the one that was in use before a button event.</li>

      <li>The source html cannot specify a namespace if cw_tidy is
      on.</li>

      <li>Caution must be used with URLs leaving out a required
      trailing slash ("/").</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Scripts</h3>
    <p>
    Limited support is provided for included scripts, but they
    may not work exactly as they would when viewed directly.
    Note in particular that if your script generates URLs, they will
    probably need to be absolute URLs, not relative, to work through
    a portal.
    </p>
    <p>
    XHTML 1.0 indicates that an XHTML document must be valid XML so
    if embedded JavaScript code contains <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>,
    <b>&gt;</b> or <b>&#8722;&#8722;</b>,
    it must be wrapped in a CDATA section element.  However, CDATA
    sections are recognized by XML processors but not browsers. According
    to XHTML 1.0, external scripts should be used if your script uses
    those character sequences. CWebProxy supports embedded
    JavaSript containing these characters only if it is wrapped in
    a CDATA section element and sent through JTidy. Note that the
    output will not be valid XML, and thus not valid XHTML.
    </p>

    <a id="changes" name="changes"></a>
    <h2>Major Changes since uPortal 2.0.2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multivalued http request attributes are now supported.</li>
      <li>Keyword-style HTTP query strings are now supported.</li>
      <li>The channel now implements the IMultithreadedCachable interface
      for better performance.</li>
      <li>Back-end HTTP applications are sent parameters using the method
      by which the channel was invoked by the browser.  Previously GET was
      always used.</li>
      <li>URL-rewriting is done via SAX filters rather than
      XSL stylesheet.</li>
      <li>Communication with applications goes through the new
      LocalConnectionContext, allowing local interface technology
      and policy to be implemented without modifying CWebProxy</li>
      <li>IPerson attributes may now optionally be passed to the
      application automatically.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
    The unmodified Tomcat numguess.jsp and servlet examples are
    set up as examples in uPortal as distributed.  They can be seen
    in the <b>CWebProxy Examples</b> tab of the demo user, and are
    available for subscription via Preferences. See the
    webpages/media/org/jasig/portal/channels/webproxy/examples
    directory for the info and help files.
    </p>
    <p>
    Further examples can be found in the
    <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/tutorial/">tutorial</a>
    on the <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/">CWebProxy home page</a>.
    </p>

    <a id="depend" name="depend"></a>
    <h2>Software Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
    CWebProxy uses the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/">JTidy</a> package
    is used to convert HTML to XHTML.
    </p>
    <p>
    Under some servlet containers, JTidy r6 has a compatibility
    problem with the classloader.  This is an issue for some versions
    of Tomcat, for example.  You will know you've got this problem
    if CWebProxy isn't working and you see a line in your logfile
    that says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>Registered an uncaughted exception
      java.lang.IllegalAccessError: try to access field
      org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl._parseHead from class
      org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl$ParseHTML</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The JTidy developers have <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001AprJun/0173.html">
    noted the problem</a>, and hopefully will fix it in the next
    release. In the meantime, it can be worked around by
    recompiling for your platform. To do this, get the <a
    href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jtidy/jtidy-04aug2000r6.zip">
    source distribution</a>, unzip it, build it with "ant jar", and
    replace your old tidy.jar with build/Tidy.jar. I've put a
    Tidy.jar rebuilt on Linux
    <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/tidy.jar">here</a>,
    if you'd prefer to try that first.
