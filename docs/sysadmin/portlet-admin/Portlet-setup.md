# Portlet Setup
After a portlet-definition has been imported into uPortal, users in the Portal Adminstrators group can incorporate portlets into the user experience.

To access, click to the _Portlet Administration Launcher_.  Select a portlet and click _Edit_.

In the _Edit_ page, there are various sections such as _Summary Information_, _Controls_, _Principals and Categories_, etc.

The _Controls_ section provides global abilities for the portlet based on general groups.  For instance, if a _Controls_ _Configure_ option is set (and supported by the portlet definition), anyone in the Portal Adminstrators group can access the _Configure_ link in the upper-right-hand dropdown of the portlet UI.

The _Principals and Categories_ sections allows more fine-tuning for the portlet.

In the _Principals_ subsection, you can select a set of Principals (such as group-memberships) to have certain abilities with this portlet.  _Browse_ will allow users in the targeted Principal to search for the portlet in the customize drawer.  _Subscribe_ will allow users in the targeted Principal to drag-and-drop or _Add_ a portlet from the customize drawer into their portlet layout.  _Configure_ will allow users in the targeted Principal the same ability to access the _Configure_ link in the user-right-hand dropdown of the portlet UI, just as if they were in the Portlet Adminstrators group.
