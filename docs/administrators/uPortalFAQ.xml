             <para>This Freqently Asked Questions (FAQ) list will
             attempt to answer some of the most common questions
             relating to uPortal.  Although this FAQ contains some

             to uPortal and not a comprehensive reference document.
             See the references section, below, for a comprehensive

       <qandaentry>
          <question>
             <para>Why can't you just use Microsoft Word
             <filename>.doc</filename> files?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>

             <para>Three reasons: Microsoft .doc files are not
             portable, the file format is proprietary, and the format
             changes often and in highly undocumented and incompatible
             ways.</para>

             <para>Microsoft Word .doc files are inherently
             non-portable because they are only designed to be read
             and modified by Microsoft Word or other programs in the
             Microsoft Office Suite. Since Word is not available for
             all the platforms supported by uPortal, we choose not to
             use it so as to not hinder the use and deployment of
             uPortal on platforms which do not have a version of MS
             Word available for them. A sizeable portion of the
             members of JA-SIG use platforms that do not have a
             version of Word available for them as their primary
             computing platform, for both development and
             deployment.</para>

             <para>The Word file format is proprietary to Microsoft
             and certain aspects of it are patented, which would
             prevent JA-SIG developers from developing and
             distributing tools that use it free of charge. Microsoft
             does make libraries for reading and writing .doc files
             available to third parties, but those libraries are only
             available for Microsoft operating systems and compilers
             and thus are inherently non-portable. </para>

             <para>The .doc file format changes rapidly, sometimes
             with every new version of Microsoft Office and/or
             Word. Some versions aren't even completely portable
             across different versions of MS Word and to non-Windows
             operating systems with a version of MS Word
             available. Steering clear of .doc files completely allows
             us to avoid dictating which specific version of MS Word
             readers of our documents must use. </para>

          </answer>
       </qandaentry>


       <qandaentry>
          <question>
             <para>What's so great about DocBook?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>

             <para>There are at least three great reasons for us to
             use DocBook: The document files are portable, the files
             interoperate with tools from multiple vendors and the
             process for changing the set of defined tags is open and
             well-publicized.</para>

             <para>DocBook files are portable because they are simply
             normal text files with tags marking up the data or prose.
             Any operating system that supports the ISO standards for
             text, including Unicode, can successfully host a DocBook
             file.</para>

             <para>DocBook files can be created, displayed and
             modified by any tool that can process XML. In addition to
             the myriad of commercial tools available on the market
             for processing XML, there are several free and/or
             open-source tools available for use with XML
             documents. An important thing to keep in mind is that
             these tools interoperate, that is, you can use one tool
             to create a DocBook file, use a tool from a completely
             different source to process it and use yet another to
             display it, with no loss of fidelity due to
             translation. </para>

             <para>The DocBook tag set changes with time, but the
             changes are publicized by OASIS so that users and vendors
             can prepare for them.  The rules for making such changes
             are well-publicized and specific. For example, minor
             releases of the DocBook can add to the markup model, but
             not change it in a backward-incompatible way. Major
             releases can introduce backwardly-incompatible changes,
             but those changes must be announced in the previous
             release, which must pre-date the new version by at least
             one year. Finally, OASIS makes every version of the
             DocBook Document Type Definition available for free on
             the World-Wide Web.</para>

             <para>One of the primary benefits of using DocBook is
             common to any strctured markup language: separation of
             semantics and presentation, which facilitates software
             translation of the document into multiple formats. For
             uPortal, we're currently using HTML for the web and PDF
             for both on-line viewing and support for high-quality
             printing. We generate both formats from exactly the same
             set of DocBook source files, and if we choose to support
             another format in the future, say,
             <filename>.rtf</filename> or some format that hasn't yet
             been invented, we can do so without changing the original
             source documents. </para>

          <question>
             <para>But wait...I can't find the PDF version of the FAQ!</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
             <para>You're probably looking in a directory structure
             produced by a direct checkout from the CVS
             repository. Since PDF files can get large, we only
             produce them when we issue a release of uPortal. The
             latest source XML files, however, are always available
             from the repository. If you'd like to look at PDF
             versions of the uPortal docs in their development state,
             you have to build the .pdf file from source using the
             tools described in the README file in the docs/
             directory.</para>
