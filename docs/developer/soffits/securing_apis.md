# Securing APIs

Soffit projects often provide HTTP-based APIs for supplying data to UI components or performing
operations on persistent data stores.  In fact, this practice is preferred and recommended over
_Server-Side Rendering_ strategies that generate dynamic HTML with data already baked-in.  Modules
that provide separate "front-end" (UI) and "back-end" (server-side) logic are easier to understand,
maintain, and extend.

In most cases these module-provided APIs follow the principals of <i>Representational State
Transfer</i> (REST) and use JSON as a data exchange format.  Both of these practices are also
preferred and recommended.

Often these APIs require some information from a trusted source.  For example, they may need to know
the identity and/or characteristics of the user, may provide access to sensitive data, or both.

uPortal provides a simple, secure way of sharing this information with module-provided APIs (_i.e._
APIs within uPortal modules).  This capability is based on the
`SoffitApiPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter` and [Spring Security][].  The Java class files for this
feature are available in the `uPortal-soffit-renderer` dependency.

:notebook:  A module need not be a Soffit to use these features, but it really _should_ be a module.
In other words, APIs that are secured using this approach should have providing data and services
_within the portal_ as their original and essential purpose.  The reason for this distinction is
that the information this approach provides is proxy of the user's profile _within the portal_, and
that may not be (often isn't) the same thing as the user's identity within the organization.

## Example Implementation

This capability is based on the `SoffitApiPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter` and [Spring Security][].
The Java class files for this feature are available in the `uPortal-soffit-renderer` dependency.

The `SoffitApiPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter` relies on a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization`
HTTP header.  You can obtain an appropriate token from uPortal's `userinfo` endpoint, which is found
at the following URI: `/uPortal/api/v5-1/userinfo`.  Any portal user (including unauthenticated
users) may obtain a personal token from this endpoint.  This token should be obtained with
JavaScript and passed (also with JavaScript) as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header in
API requests.

Refer to the sections below to secure API endpoints and access information about the portal user.

### `uPortal-soffit-renderer` Dependency (Gradle Example)

```groovy
compile "org.jasig.portal:uPortal-soffit-renderer:${uPortalVersion}"
```

### Spring Security Configuration

This example defines the following rules for accessing API enpoints that begin with `/api`:

  - Authenticated users may send `GET` and `POST` requests
  - No users may send any other type of request

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Value("${" + SIGNATURE_KEY_PROPERTY + ":" + DEFAULT_SIGNATURE_KEY + "}")
    private String signatureKey;

    @Override
    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
        /*
         * Since this module includes portlets, we only want to apply Spring Security to requests
         * targeting our REST APIs.
         */
        final RequestMatcher pathMatcher = new AntPathRequestMatcher("/api/**");
        final RequestMatcher inverseMatcher = new NegatedRequestMatcher(pathMatcher);
        web.ignoring().requestMatchers(inverseMatcher);
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

        /*
         * Provide a SoffitApiPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter (from uPortal) that is NOT a
         * top-level bean in the Spring Application Context.
         */
        final AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter filter =
                new SoffitApiPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter(signatureKey);
        filter.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager());

        http
            .addFilter(filter)
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET,"/api/**").authenticated()
                .antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST,"/api/**").authenticated()
                .antMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE,"/api/**").denyAll()
                .antMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT,"/api/**").denyAll()
                .anyRequest().permitAll();
            .and()
            /*
             * Session fixation protection is provided by uPortal.  Since portlet tech requires
             * sessionCookiePath=/, we will make the portal unusable if other modules are changing
             * the sessionId as well.
             */
            .sessionManagement()
                .sessionFixation().none();

    }

    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager() {
        return new SoffitApiAuthenticationManager();
    }

    @Bean
    public ErrorPageFilter errorPageFilter() {
        return new ErrorPageFilter();
    }

    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean disableSpringBootErrorFilter() {
        /*
         * The ErrorPageFilter (Spring) makes extra calls to HttpServletResponse.flushBuffer(),
         * and this behavior produces many warnings in the portal logs during portlet requests.
         */
        FilterRegistrationBean filterRegistrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean();
        filterRegistrationBean.setFilter(errorPageFilter());
        filterRegistrationBean.setEnabled(false);
        return filterRegistrationBean;
    }

}
```

### Accessing User Information within the API

Information about the user can be obtained from the Spring `SecurityContextHolder`:

```java
final Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
final String username = (String) authentication.getPrincipal();
final Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = authentication.getAuthorities();
```
