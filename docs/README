Compiling
------------

To compile these source files into a more human-readable format, you
must have some tools already installed.

   ----------------------------   --------------
   Ant:                           jakarta.apache.org/ant/
   DocBook XSL stylesheets:       www.nwalsh.com/docbook/xsl/

From this single set of source files, you can produce xhtml, html, or
.pdf. RTF is also possible, but we haven't tested this.
