/**
 *  The Logger class is used to output messages to a log file. The first call to
 *  a log method triggers an initialization which renames old logs and creates a
 *  new log with a message stating the current time and log level. The maximum
 *  number of backup log files is specified as a member variable and can be set
 *  by calling setMaxBackupLogFiles (). When calling a log method, it is
 *  necessary to specify a log level which can be either NONE, SEVERE, ERROR,
 *  WARN, INFO, or DEBUG (listed in order of decreasing severity). Log messages
 *  will only be logged if their log level is the same or more severe than the
 *  static member log level, which can be changed by calling setLogLevel ().
 *  Zed's NOTES: This has been completely re-written to use the Log4J system
 *  entirely. This means that you can now write wonderful config files which let
 *  you pick your own log format and your own ouput methods. It will also now
 *  watch the config file for changes and reload them (thus, letting you make
 *  changes without restarting the Portal).
