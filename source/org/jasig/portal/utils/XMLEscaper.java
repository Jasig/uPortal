/**
 * This utility provides a simple way of escaping the special or

 * and http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-predefined-ent
 * and http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-entexpand
 * Most of the code was borrowed from Xerces serializer classes.
 * If anyone finds a useable method in a standard XML API
 * that escapes XML strings, we should use it in place of this class.
