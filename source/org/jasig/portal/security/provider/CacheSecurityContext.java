/**
 * <p>This is an implementation of a SecurityContext that performs absolutely
 * NO validation of the Principal but merely caches the claimed password.
 * We implement this to provide the illusion of single-signon but it comes
 * with significant risk. A channel is able to retrieve the originally
 * validated password of passphrase to perform just-in-time validation but the
 * means of validation is now COMPLETELY in the hands of the channel. If the
 * channel utilizes a weak authenticity-checking mechanism and the password is
 * the same as the one that portal users regard as secure, then unbeknownst to
 * the user, their "secure" password is being placed in jeopardy. PLEASE use
 * this SecurityContext implementation sparingly and with your eyes open!</p>
