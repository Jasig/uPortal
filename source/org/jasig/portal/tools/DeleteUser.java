/**
 * This method was always kind of funky, and maybe it still is.  It 
 * used to go directly to the local group store to get memberships 
 * for a user rather than through the group service.  For a number
 * of reasons, including the fact that groups are cached in the JVM,
 * the current group service design tries to frustrate that sort of
 * guerilla activity by making you use the service facade.  In this 
 * version, we get ALL of the user's memberships and remove the user 
 * from those groups that are updatable, which will typically be the 
 * groups from the local service.  The method is synchronized to 
 * reduce the likelihood of concurrent updates to the same group, but 
 * that only works if this program runs in the same process as the 
 * portal, and not, e.g., as an ant task.  
 * 
 * @param userName String - the IPerson.USERNAME of the ex-user.
