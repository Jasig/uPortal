/**
 * This controller provides an endpoint through which clients can obtain an ID Token in a format
 * that is aligned with with OpenID Connect (OIDC). <i>Clients</i> in this case are normally content
 * objects embedded within the portal page itself (e.g. portlets, soffits, or JS bundles).
 *
 * <p>It is critical to point out that this endpoint is not a compliant OIDC Identity Provider. It
 * does not implement OAuth Authentication Flows of any sort. The user (<code>sub</code> in the ID
 * Token) is either logged into the portal (ahead of time) or isn't.
 *
 * <p>The value of this endpoint is not (therefore) that it brings support for OIDC to uPortal, but
 * that other modules and services designed to work with uPortal can implement security using
 * standard OIDC approaches.
