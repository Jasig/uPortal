YOU WILL DIE IF YOU DON'T READ THIS!!!!

That's the warning I have to give you before you do anything with the control
panel.  It is a dangerous piece of software that MUST be protected from
all unauthorized access and should be completely tested before put on ANY
application server.

That deserve's repeating:

The control panel is a dangerous piece of software that MUST be protected from
all unauthorized access and should be completely tested before put on ANY
application server.

If you still want to use the control panel, then do this:

1)  Create a directory in your document root called control_panel.
2)  PROTECT THIS DIRECTORY!  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  I don't care how you
do it.  Hordes of elves!  A .htaccess file.  Only allow from local host 
and use SSH tunnels to get to it.  I don't care, just PROTECT IT!
3)  Put all the jsp pages in this directory, in the control_panel directory
you created.
4)  MAKE SURE THAT ONLY AUTHORIZED PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THESE FILES!
5)  Try the Kick Guests feature.  If it throws an exception, or kicks
off ALL users, then DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE.  If this is the case, it would
be smart to complete remove the jsp files beginning with kick_guest from the
harddrive and take the links to them out of the other jsp pages.
6)  Use it carefully.

That's all.  Just thought everyone should be careful when using this thing. 
It is tested, but each application server does different things to their
sessions, so it isn't guaranteed to work.  The good thing is, when Sun 
completely removes all session management code from the Servlet API, you'll
still be able to use the Kick Users feature (although, not Kick Guests).

One more thing:  You don't really need Kick Guests.  The guest users take
up such a small amount of memory that it really isn't necessary to kick them
off.
