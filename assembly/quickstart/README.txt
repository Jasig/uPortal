Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The uPortal source code is included with this distribution. A seperate
 build.xml exists in the @uportal.name@ directory that provides Ant targets to
 deploy changes made to the included uPortal source to the quickstart tomcat
 instance. To run Ant targets for the included uPortal source code cd into the
 @uportal.name@ directory. Running the following command from the @uportal.name@
 directory will list available uPortal Ant targets:

ant -p

-Log messages for uPortal appear in @tomcat.name@/portal.log. Log files for
 Tomcat appear in @tomcat.name@/logs
 

Developing with the Quickstart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The developers build of the quickstart (distinguished by a -dev suffix in the
download name) includes a copy of uPortal that is still 'attached' to subversion.
Running svn commands in the @uportal.name@ directory will work as if you checked
out uPortal from the JA-SIG Subversion repository.
