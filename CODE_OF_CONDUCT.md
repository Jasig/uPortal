# Code of Conduct

uPortal is an Apereo Foundation sponsored project.

The [Apereo Foundation Welcoming Policy][] therefore applies.

In addition to reporting mechanisms under that Policy, participants may at any time contact the uPortal Steering Committee ( `uportal-steering-committee@apereo.org` ) about any matter, and may designate their contact as confidential if they prefer. All contact will be acknowledged. Contacts regarding issues covered by the Welcoming Policy will be handled in a manner consistent with that policy.

In addition to the commitments under Apereo Foundation policy generally, uPortal is committed to 
welcoming participation and contribution. The contributing guidelines for this repository lead with
this:

> If you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. 
  You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be 
  politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall
  of rules to get in the way of that.
