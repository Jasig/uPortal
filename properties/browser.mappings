# This properties file defines a system profile mapping for
# common browsers.
# Each properties line assignes a regular expression for the
# user agent string to a profile id.
#
# Note: order in which regexs are listed is important !
# The code will evaluate each regex from top to bottom,
# reporting a profile mapping as soon as something matches.
# That means, that something like Netscape's user agent
# should be matched last, since the regex for it is more
# general then that of IE.
#
# Suggestions: to optimize the matching process, describe most 
# popular browsers first
