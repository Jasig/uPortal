        <description>
          The syntax for the portlet definition ID is the name of the
          portlet application context name, followed by a period, followed by
          the name of the portlet as defined in the portlet deployment descriptor
          (portlet.xml). For example, if the portlet is located in a file called
          \n\nMyPortletApp.war\n\n and the portlet has a name of
          \n\nMyFirstPortlet\n\n then the portlet definition ID would be
          \n\nMyPortletApp.MyFirstPortlet\n\n

        These are the preferences of the portlet itself.  There may
        be zero or more preferences.
