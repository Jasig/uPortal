This is a history channel, part of the inter-channel communication demonstration. This channel shows the last 10 URLs that have been viewed in the viewer channel. Click on a URL to view it again in the CViewer channel. Note that this will, in turn, cause CViewer to update the history. ::: This is a history channel, part of the inter-channel communication demonstration.

Hitting one of the URLs in the above list will cause CHistory to pass the URL to the CViewer channel.  One way of doing this is internally \(through JNDI contexts, directly to the CViewer channel\).  Another is by using uPortal's URL syntax \(uP_channelTarget\) and passing a "url" parameter to the CURLSelector, so that the selector channel could then signal CViewer. ::: Hitting one of the URLs in the above list will cause CHistory to pass the URL to the CViewer channel.
