      <description>
        Bookmarks sets are defined per-user per-key.  Bookmarks portlet instances for a given user sharing keys will display and manage the same bookmarks.
        Bookmarks portlet instances for a given user with different keys will display and manage entirely distinct bookmarks sets.  Bookmarks portlet instances
        for two different users will display and manage distinct sets of bookmarks regardless of keys.
