  The modify attribute is set in the CPD document and affects the output of the
  Publish and Subscribe interfaces based on the possible values described below:


  publish
  =======
  the publisher can set the parameter value and can also
  control (via a checkbox) whether or not the user should
  be able to override the value at subscribe time - defaults
  to not letting the subscriber override

  subscribe
  =========
  same as above except defaults to letting the
  subscriber override

  publish-only
  ============
  the parameter value is set by the publisher
  (publisher cannot change this)

  subscribe-only
  ==============
  the parameter value is set by the subscriber
  (publisher cannot change this)
