##
##  CAS example
##  The following is an example of configuring uPortal to use both CAS
##  and local user authentication (authentication by username and password
##  hash stored in the uPortal database).  It uses the UnionSecurityContext
##  to consider both these authentication methods and declares the required
##  tokens for all.  This approach requires the corresponding filter mappings
##  in web.xml (mapping both the CASValidateFilter and the StaticCasReceiptCacher
##  filter in front of the LoginServlet).

## It would be better to escape the value of the url parameter, but since there are no parameters on the
## unescaped URL and since there are no further parameters on the logout URL, this does work.
