<!--    
   - The Resin configuration file.    
   -    
   - This example file is more complicated than is needs to be because    
   - it makes several configurations explicit that can be simplified and    
   - because it needs to configure the examples.    
   -    
   - Look in conf/samples for more realistic sample configurations.    
   -   conf/samples/simple.conf - a simple, basic configuration    
   -   conf/samples/deploy.conf - a simple configuration for deployment    
   -    
   - The configuration is based on a purely element-based XML.  To make    
   - it easier to read, attributes can be used as syntactic sugar.    
   -    
   - The following are equivalent:    
   - <foo><bar>13</bar></foo>  - canonical representation, but verbose    
   - <foo bar=13/>             - typical configuration    
   - <foo><bar id=13/></foo>   - sometimes useful
