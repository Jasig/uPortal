/**
 * Checks that DOM level 3 is present.
 * uPortal requires level 3 of the DOM (org.w3c.dom) APIs.
 * JDK 1.4 shipped with a DOM 2 implementation of this API in its rt.jar, so
 * deployers using JDK 1.4 must override with the JAXP 1.3
 * implementation of these APIs.  Deployers using JDK 1.5 need do nothing as 
 * JAXP 1.3 is included in baseline JDK 1.5.
 * 
 * This check verifies that level 3 of the APIs is available
 * by exercising a method that exists in DOM3 but not in DOM2.
 * 
 * @version $Revision$ $Date$
