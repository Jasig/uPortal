 * Interface added solely to get around threads needing to be tagged when

 * Fragment owners do not have proper roles. To fix this problem bug 19794
 * was opened and this interface enables schools to declare which roles a
 * fragment owner should have and propagate that configuration into LDAP using
 * our groups manager. But we can't have any compile time dependancies so this
 * interface allows us to place the implementing code over in the cp tree and
 * instantiate the class via the class name and call it via its implementation
 * of this interface.
